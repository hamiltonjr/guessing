# Guessing Game
This simple program is my first serious code after Hello World! The aim is learn Rust and begin to develop new versions of Unix-like apps (head, tail, grep, cut, ls, echo).

This code is an improvement of a Guessing Game found in "The Book" (The Rust Programming Language - Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols). It was developed during the book reading.
